# Overview of the project

The purpose of this collaborative project is to create a new way for Pizza Hut to accept online bulk orders. The current system relies on communication through phone calls to place large orders. The proposed system will enable users to order large quantities of pizza online through an interface that feels similar and cohesive with the current Pizza Hut ordering experience.
